	There is a saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Your spinal health is no exception. Posture and spinal screenings by a trained and experienced chiropractor such as Dr. Mansoureh Barahemi can help reveal important health information, unlocking the door to improved health and well-being. In order to help the Rancho Palos Verdes community, we provide screenings at area malls, community events, health fairs and places of employment. Contact us today at (310) 519-8877 to arrange a screening at your event or workplace.
