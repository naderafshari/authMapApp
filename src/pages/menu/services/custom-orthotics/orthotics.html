	Individually designed custom made stabilizing Orthotics are designed to correct imbalances in your feet and throughout your body. Would you wear eyeglasses that weren't prescribed for you? Or take an over-the-counter drug for a problem that requires a prescription drug? Of course not. Unlike over-the-counter Orthotics, our Stabilizing Orthotics are individually designed for your unique postural problems â€” not just problems with your feet. We believe that correcting imbalances in your feet can properly align your spine and pelvis.

	Our Stabilizing Orthotics offer more than just short-term symptom relief. They also promote whole-body wellness for your life.
